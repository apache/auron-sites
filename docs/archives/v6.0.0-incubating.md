## New Features
* New Configurations: Introduced settings for decimal operations, JSON parsing fallback, Parquet reader, native logging, and compression.
* Memory Management: Improve memory management using Linux RSS (resident set size).
* Operators: Supports operator fusion in Sort -> SortMergeJoin execution, reducing costs of join key serialization.
* Enhanced Compatibility: Added support for JDK 17 and Scala 2.13.
* New Functions: Added support for trim in casts and extended hashing function coverage.

## Improvements
* Stability: Improved handling of stage retry on shuffle failures and memory spilling.
* Modularity: Restructured codebase by extracting Celeborn, Uniffle, and Paimon into separate 3rdparty modules.
* Observability: Improved logging with Thread IDs and enhanced Spark UI metrics for skew detection.
* Uniffle Integration: Improved support and documentation for Uniffle shuffle manager.
* Minor Performance Improvement: Optimized batch serde, array interleavig and coalescing.
* Build & CI: Enhanced build scripts, added ARM support, and streamlined the CI process.

## Bug Fixes
* Data Correctness: Fixed critical issues in join logic, value comparisons, and hash calculations.
* Memory Leaks & Crashes: Resolved memory management issues and NPEs.
* Execution Engine: Fixed errors in outer generate, UDTF execution, and Parquet sink tasks.
* Integration: Corrected issues with 3rdparty systems like Celeborn and Uniffle.

NOTE: This release includes a significant number of performance optimizations, memory management improvements, bug fixes, and new features, with notable enhancements in shuffle management, execution engine optimization, and third-party integration. Some minor changes are not included in the above list, please see the commit list for more details.
